** odfingest: warning (EpnFrameTimeMismatch), The window coordinates indicate this to be either `PrimeFullWindow' or `PrimeFullWindowExtended' mode but the read frame time 6 [ms] does not match the nominal values (73/199 [ms]) of either of those and the parameter F1293 (FRAME_TIME_PARAMETER) is not present - the frame time is likely to be the latter where the lack of an accurate FRAMETIME keyword for `PrimeFullWindowExtended' is a known ODF problem - will continue with `PrimeFullWindowExtended'. If you have created a summary file with odfingest you can check the value of FRAME_TIME_PARAMETER for this PN exposure. If it is not equal to 0 this is indeed an `PrimeFullWindowExtended' exposure.
